### What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It simplifies things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation, providing an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With jQuery, you can write less and do more.

## Key Features

- **HTML/DOM manipulation**: Simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development.
- **Event Handling**: Makes it easy to capture a wide variety of user interactions and respond to them in real time.
- **AJAX Support**: Simplifies making asynchronous requests to your server.
- **Animation**: Easily create custom animations for your web projects.
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Write code that works consistently across all major browsers.
